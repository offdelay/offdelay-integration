        Offdelay provides the ability to [download diagnostic data](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics).

        **It would really help if you could download the diagnostics data for
        the configuration you are having issues with, and <ins>drag-and-drop
        that file into the textbox below.</ins>**

        It generally allows pinpointing defects and thus resolving issues
        faster.


        Please note: GSP locations are randomized by offsetting the latitude and
        longitude of each location by a random amount, but the same random
        amount is used for every point. This helps keep your location data
        slightly more anonymized, but someone could still use this information
        to obtain insight into your personal offdelays. Please consider this
        before submitting your diagnostic information.
